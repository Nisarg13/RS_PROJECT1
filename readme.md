# NPR Interview Recommendation System

## Overview
A Jupyter Notebook project leveraging NPR Media Dialog Data to recommend interviews. It utilizes NLP and machine learning for analyzing transcripts to find similar content.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x, Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK/Spacy, Scikit-learn

## Setup
Install Jupyter and required libraries. Clone/download the repository.

## Usage
Navigate to the project folder, run `jupyter notebook`, and open the `.ipynb` file to explore the recommendation system.

## Contribute
Fork, improve, and pull request. For bugs or suggestions, open an issue.

## Work distribution
Nisarg Ganatra: 
Nisarg's work on preprocessing steps and the code to recommend episodes based on keywords, utilizing TF-IDF matrix and cosine similarity, has been invaluable to enhancing the system's performance and accuracy.

Shubham Shah:

This  part of project encompasses a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a podcast episodes dataset, followed by the development of a personalized recommendation system. The workflow includes preprocessing textual data, extracting features through TF-IDF vectorization, encoding categorical data, and leveraging user preferences to generate personalized content recommendations.


The system outputs personalized episode recommendations for users, indicated by a list of top N recommended items for each user, enhancing content discoverability and user engagement.

Deepak Khatri:
I focused on processing episodes and utterances from CSV files, ensuring data was clean and ready for further analysis. This involved extensive preprocessing to refine the data. For the recommendation feature, I developed a system using the TF-IDF matrix derived from the cleaned utterances, enabling podcast recommendations based on episode ID, and delivering top N suggestions effectively.


Vikram:
Mainly worked on EDA part.
