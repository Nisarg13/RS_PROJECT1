And even Lance said yesterday that for him, the -any chance of winning the tour has gone out the window. He still does have a teammate on his team, RadioShack team, American Levi Leipheimer currently in eighth place, two minutes, 14 seconds back. And Lance is going to do what he can to help Leipheimer do well.\",\n",

And what you have is basically the team leader, sort of your queen bee, and then eight worker bees working to keep that queen safe and happy for when the decisive moments of the race come. In cycling, a lot of the energy goes toward actually battling wind resistance. So if you're riding behind another rider, you can be using up to 30 percent less energy because you're in that slipstream of the rider who's battling the wind. So team riders will ride on the front, protect their leader. You'll often see a team member drift back to the team car to fetch water bottles to keep their leader well hydrated.\",\n",

And then sometimes you can see they've actually decided who might be able to win the stage that day.

These guys are burning anywhere between six and 9,000 calories every day just to move their bicycles over the terrain. Nine thousand calories is the upper limits on some of those more difficult mountain stages. And that's more than the average American should eat in four-plus days to give you some sense of scale.

Some years, it goes in a counterclockwise circle around France. This year going clockwise, where it's hitting the Alps mountains before the Pyrenees. And you're seeing tiny villages. You're seeing just breathtaking mountainscapes. You go into the Pyrenees, you see the Basque flags and the fans wearing orange, cheering.\",\n",

The Sunnis don't want to sign off at all, and so as we go      towards this deadline in a few hours here, the Kurds and the Shiites are      talking to the press and saying, `We think we've got it all stitched up.

Obviously, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has been leading the charge there. But these two American teams are now in full action. We have one lot - diplomatic and NSC, Defense Department officials in South Korea and crossing over to North Korea to have talks about substance with the North Korean representatives. That means denuclearization. And meanwhile, we have a separate team on its way to Singapore to talk to North Koreans there about logistics for the meeting that's set to take place.

You know, President Moon had only been back in Seoul for 24 hours after visiting President Trump in the White House when the summit was, like, abruptly canceled. And the look on his face at that midnight meeting, you know, said it all. He was clearly shocked by this turn of events. But they swung into action immediately. And on Friday, President Moon and president - sorry, Kim Jong Un of North Korea talked. And they arranged to have this meeting the following day on Saturday face to face in Panmunjom in the DMZ, which is really kind of unprecedented to think this is only the fourth time in 18 years that the two Korean leaders have ever met, and they were able to pull it off with 24 hours' notice.

The signals coming out of North Korea over the past few days have been very kind of positive in that direction. But also, Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, you know, he is really invested in this process. And he desperately wants this to work because the other option if diplomacy fails may be military action, and that would be devastating for South Korea and the capital of Seoul. So one analyst we spoke to likened Moon Jae-in to a ball boy in a tennis match.

Dr. Benvy, alone at Texas A&M, spent years working on flavor compounds and then Philby and myself - Phil made many crosses.  We took them to the farm, grew them out, segregated them, isolated them.  For instance, a chili ancho - if you're familiar with ancho or flavano(ph) - tends to have a high rate of chlorophyll in it.  It has a chlorophyll retainer gene.  That in itself causes it to be a deep dark green, gives it a different flavor.  But then there's starch genes or sugar genes that when you start combining those - the fellow that called in and asked about flavor versus heat, that's exactly - one of our challenges is, years ago when Arizona 20 that Phil bred became the standard of the industry, that was a great yielder, a great canner, and the heat level was very stable in it.  But the flavor was very bland.\",\n",

The wahil chili is a high-oil content chili, dry and has a much different flavor than it does green.  We crossed the wahil with an Anaheim type, the Mexico 6 type, if you will.  And we got a complete different set of flavors out of that thing than we ever expected.  So breeding is so fun.  I feel so blessed to be able to work with Phil because through the years, we made so many crosses and seen so many different things.

And these chilies actually require - and that's one of the projects we have right now, to find out how much water do they require, how do they - when do they require that water and what are the different rates of consumptive use that they have over the course of season.  It's about 32 to 35 inches of water that the plant actually uses as we call it through (unintelligible) transpiration or consumptive use out of the system.\",\n",

And also they repel or resist molding in the fruits, so that the seeds don't die that way, but ironically the seed dispersers of chilis, which are a number of birds including cardinals and pyrrhuloxias don't taste that heat.  So, ironically birds like some people are non-tasters of the capsaicinoids and so, they readily seek the chilis out for their oils and their flavor compounds that they do pick up.  And they benefit from the many rich vitamin compounds in chilis.  So, essentially I say, when my little son asked me why chilis are hot, I say so birds can disperse them to nurse trees and other critters will not.\",\n",

And we realized that most of that bird seed wasn't being eaten by the birds at all that we are trying to interpret and present to the public, but that desert mice and house mice, and rats had gotten into the aviary and they were eating most of the food.\",\n",

              " \"The irony of today's case is that it involves massive cellphone thefts, a string of armed robberies at RadioShacks in Michigan and Ohio. The robbers entered the stores, guns drawn, herded patrons to the back, loaded up laundry bags with new smartphones and then later sold their booty for tens of thousands of dollars per haul. In April of 2011, police arrested four men, one of whom confessed that he and a shifting group of 15 others had robbed nine different stores over the previous year. The suspect identified Timothy Carpenter as one of the ringleaders. The thieves all pleaded guilty except for Carpenter and his half brother. At their trial, the icing on the prosecution case was the cellphone location information recorded by Carpenter's wireless provider for each of the calls he placed or received on the dates of the robberies.\",\n",
              " \"Now, remember, this was seven years ago and several smartphone generations. The information used at Carpenter's trial was not exactly precise. It did not record where he was when he texted or where he was when his phone was not in use, but when he made or received calls, the cellphone towers nearby recorded his general location with an accuracy range of about a half mile to two miles. And guess what? Those calls matched up rather nicely with the vicinity of the robberies. While there was eyewitness and video evidence against Carpenter, too, his lawyer Harold Gurwitz said the painfully irrefutable evidence was the cellphone data.\",\n",
              " \"It's the kind of evidence that in the end is the most difficult to argue to a jury that they shouldn't credit because the records are what they are.\",\n",
              " \"The question before the Supreme Court is whether the cops should have gotten a search warrant in order to obtain the cell location information. That would have required them to show a judge that they had probable cause to believe those records contained evidence of a crime. What they did instead was obtain a court order under the federal Stored Communications Act, which is easier. In this case, as in others, prosecutors argue that the Supreme Court has long viewed information shared by a consumer as fair game without a warrant. Even before the stored records law was enacted, the high court ruled that you lose your Fourth Amendment right to privacy when you share information with a third party like the phone company. Fourth Amendment scholar Orin Kerr contends that the idea of tracking someone's movements in public is not new. The police, for instance, tail a suspect or check on his alibi. Only when they search the suspect's home or person do they have to get a court-approved warrant. As to the general cell location data at issue in this case, he maintains...\",\n",

The Supreme Court has in recent years laid down some new rules for the digital age. If the police use a GPS tracking device to monitor a person's life over a long term, they do need a search warrant. And if they seize a smartphone at the time of an arrest, in order to view its contents, they need a warrant for that, too.

He's the director of the PlanetLab Consortium, an experiment into new networking technologies. He joins us from the studios on the Princeton campus. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.\",\n",
              " 'Let me ask you all, gentlemen. Let me ask you first, Larry. Ten years from now, what will the Internet look like? Take open that crystal ball for us. Can you look into it and tell us what you think the Internet will look like, what it should look like?',\n",
              " \"Well, what I hope it looks like is it's a place that you can securely do all sorts of online transactions. I think that's something that people are really worried about today, between the various fishing and hijacking of connections and so on, that we may, in fact, be reaching a point that the average user loses trust in the Internet, and that's clearly something we have to pay attention to over the next 10 years.\",\n",
              " \"Mm hmm. I know Phil Zimmermann, who's one of the gurus of security on the Internet, has been talking about the hijacking of voice material, people talking to each other now. That could be a problem.\",\n",
              " \"This is a widespread problem. It's not just from the obvious, that you're not securely logging into your bank, but online content is under attack all the time from denial-of-service attacks and so on, so it's clearly an issue that we have to start paying attention to.\",\n",
              " 'Mm hmm. Tim Wu, what do you think the Internet could and should look like 10 years from now?',\n",
              " \"Well, it could look one of many ways. I think there's a basic debate that you mentioned earlier between something that's a much more centralized network than we have today, something more like cable television. And another vision, one which I think is better, which is rather like the Internet is today, just faster and capable of more things.\",\n",
              " \"The Internet today is very decentralized. People come up with stuff, whether it's on YouTube or whether it's eBay or whether it's, you know, people's blogs, and I hope that it retains its character as a decentralized medium that basically everyone uses, that just has a lot more bandwidth, is a lot faster, and works a lot better.\",\n",
              " 'Do we have to build a new backbone to the Internet?',\n",
              " \"Do we have to build a new backbone? You know, I mean, the new - actually backbone, if you're interested in the technical side, backbone isn't where the problem is. There's a huge amount of capacity. Back in the 1990s, companies, even like Enron, built massive amounts of capacity into the backbone.\",\n",
              " \"The real bottleneck, and this has been true since 1990, since actually about 1913, is the pipes and the wire that goes to people's homes, and the challenge over the next decade is whether we will really get the same kind of speeds on the backbone in the last mile, which is to say right to people's homes.\",\n",
              " \"Right now, we have the same networks, the cable and the telephone networks, that we've had since the 1960s. You know, they've been updated a bit, but basically it's the same old stuff, and that's the big question over the next 10 years.\",\n",
              " \"And I would add that there are great incentives to upgrade the network simple because that's what users want. When we look at our surveys at the Pew Internet Project, most people who are signing onto broadband - and now today 42 percent of Americans have high-speed connections at home - sign on for the speed. They don't tell us that the price fell and I decided to switch. The longer people stay online, the more they want to do online, and their demand for speed increases as they get more experience on the Internet.\",\n",
              " \"Are they gonna forget about speed after a while and want the services more? I mean, will speed just become part of the product, for example, want the ability to watch television or stream video or do these kinds of high bandwidth things that they don't normally do now and that they're seeing other people doing, and, you know, they're, we're beginning to download old TV shows that we missed the night before on the Internet. So is that kind of thing they're gonna worry more about than the speed?\",\n",
              " \"Well, I think they're gonna worry about both. People like to do those entertainment applications online, but one of the real markers of Internet user behavior, and it's a fairly common behavior along, across broadband Internet users, is what we call user-generated content. People like the speed in order to post things online about their lives, about what they're doing. They like to post online their own creativity.\",\n",
              " \"Now, some of that stuff is not gonna be widely interesting to the world at large, but it's interesting to users and their social networks. So they're gonna want the entertainment services, but they're gonna want to continue to have an Internet that enables them to express themselves online.\",\n",
              " 'Mm hmm.',\n",
              " 'Right. If I could add to that. I mean...',\n",
              " \"...I think there's no doubt that people, you know, people would like more bandwidth but - and people would like more services, people like watching videos. They move, and you can see people walking around. But the question is who provides them?\",\n",
              " \"I'll jump in on that. I don't quite see it as a threat as much as a phenomenon. Particularly at the country level. It's not that countries won't be able to talk to each other, it's just that they will talk to each other less. You know, when the Internet was much smaller a decade ago, there were only so many people on it and so everybody always talked to each other.\",\n",
              " \"GDP and mortality and education are the sort of basic statistics for how the nation's doing.\",\n",
              " \"And there's a basic philosophical divide between two approaches, one which is more like cable, which is basically what we've had since the '70s, which is a centralized entity like the phone company or the cable company and some producers create it, or what was just referred to, the kind of world where people just throw up random things and that's what people watch. And how you build the network, how the network gets built out will determine what kind of culture prevails. Something more like what the Internet's now, which is much more of a folky kind of culture where people watch really bad quality video 'cause they think it's funny or they read blogs almost as much as they'll read the New York Times. Or something which is more like the old media world where things like video are dominated by centralized decision makers. That's the philosophical battle behind net neutrality and a lot of other stuff going on right now.\",\n",
              " 'Larry Peterson.',\n",
              " \"I'd just like to add that of course speed is always going to be an issue and users are certainly going to demand more services from the network. But there are going to be issues of ease of use, of trust, of I'm going to want to take the Internet with me wherever I go, that I'm always connected, I always access to my data and so on.\",\n",
              " \"These, of course, are services. But, again, I get back to the issue of trust and that's going to become a very significant aspect of the consumer's view of the Internet.\",\n",
              " 'Sorry, can I step in?',\n",
              " \"I don't completely disagree with that, but I want to disagree a little bit. People have been saying since the '90s that so many things wouldn't happen on the Internet because no one trusts the Internet. Pierre Omidyar, who founded eBay, his whole founding principle was that, you know, people trust each other. And eBay has never been all that secure, but it's managed to be successful nonetheless.\",\n",
              " \"And it is sort of surprising how many things, you know, how secure the blogs need to be, how much do you have to trust them? I think there's been a bit of surprise over the last decade of how many things have happened on the Internet, even though it's not as secure as some people might like. I think that's been a bit of surprise to people.\",\n",
              " 'I think a lot agree with that.',\n",
              " 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.',\n",
              " \"So it's certainly the case that the Internet has just grown beyond expectations and people are depending on it despite all the security risks that are there. But on the other hand, what I see happening is what I would call the Internet fragmenting into gated communities.\",\n",
              " \"And this is almost like the neutrality aspect of the issue, that there are places you just can't get to and the universal connectivity of the original Internet is deteriorating. Because of a lack of security built into the Internet your only recourse is to throw up all sorts of protections that are extremely suspicious of every bit of traffic that happens to fly by.\",\n",
              " 'Can you give me an example?',\n",
              " \"So the example that I see firsthand is with a PlanetLab test bed that I run. We have researchers throughout the world inventing brand new services, the very kinds of services that we are imagining people wanting to use 10 years from now. And they deploy those on PlanetLab - let me just say for a second, what PlanetLab is, is 600 plus machines spread across the world, 35 countries, about 300 sites. And these researchers basically can use these machines as a point of presence for deploying whatever service, Internet service they want to. So they start to run these services, users start to use these services and we're constantly battling a packet that will show up at some site and will raise all sorts of alarms and, you know, threats that we need to stop this activity because it looks like an attack.\",\n",
              " \"So the point is, as you innovate and you step beyond what the Internet does today because of the security climate, there's a risk that this innovation gets thwarted.\",\n",
              " \"Can I add to that? I'll give another example. I agree partially that there's a Balkanizing effect. But I'll give another example and it's called, something called China. That is to say that the Chinese government, to a degree which wasn't true in the early Internet, has imposed the level of watchfulness and control over the Internet which is somewhat unprecedented.\",\n",
              " \"And so the kind of balkanization - this is something we write about in our book - is often at the country level; that is, countries have different ideas of what they would like the Internet to be, and so already the Chinese Internet, partially because of language and obvious difference in consumer taste, but partially also because of government control, you end up with something more of a balkanized than a global medium. So that's also going on at the same time.\",\n",
              " \"We'll come back and talk lots more about this, because it's very vital, very interesting. And we'll take your questions about the Internet and your suggestions. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.\",\n",

              " \"And so it's these sorts of assumptions that are starting to break down and causing people to think if we stood back and had a chance to design this thing over again, how would we do it?\",\n",
              " \"You know, it's becoming more and more of a national medium. So the Internet in Germany and in France, for one thing, is in German or in French, or in China, or in Japan, and it just comes to take on more national characteristics.\",\n",
              " \"It's not necessarily bad. You know, Japanese people love using the Internet from their strange-looking cell phones. Chinese people, for some reason, love chat rooms. Americans love blogs. They just like saying what they want to say.\",\n",
              " \"And so the different countries are kind of shaping the Internet to their own culture. It used to be kind of as a medium that was floating on outer space and you went there and, you know, you became this netizen. That's more becoming part of national cultures.\",\n",
              " \"And I don't necessarily think that's a crisis, I think that's kind of natural and I think that over the 10 years past here we'll see more of that.\",\n",
              " 'And if I could just jump in. You could imagine balkanization and decentralization and still have that capacity for any user to post content that any other user can access and see.',\n",

              " 'Well, still communication is the killer application. People still gravitate toward email and IMing and those sorts of things. Following on closely with that are doing Internet searches. People scratch their informational itches every day in a variety of ways by logging online and doing a search. And we find increasingly, for those of you interested in the media business, that people go online increasingly for news and leave behind other types of media such as national TV newscasts and local newspaper readings',\n",

Do they have the - share the sense of the general public that the Internet should remain a free and open place or are they siding with big business like they do on many issues?\",\n",
              " \"Well, I've been watching this and there's actually different members of Congress are different on this. And so it's hard to say generally what Congress is. I think there's a lot of grassroots reaction to some of the plans the Bells have come up with.\",\n",
              " \"The Bells have said numerous times that we're not happy with Google free-riding on our pipes. We want to create premium, a tiered Internet. Maybe we want to start choosing more of what the user's experience is like. Start tailoring it more, choosing one company over another.\",\n",
              " \"And there's a big reaction to that among users, and mostly negative, because they like the world where, you know, a blog like Boing-Boing can be as popular as CNN, and it's four people who are just goofing around part-time. And I think Americans like that folk culture feeling from the Internet.\",\n",

              " \"Well, a little bit of both. You have to argue an excellent design, because it was designed, obviously, over 30 years ago and there was no way to anticipate this sort of usage it was going to get today. So it's a very nice architecture and it's enabled unimaginable things to happen.\",\n",
              " \"There are limits to it. The world is clearly a very different place than it was 30 years ago. I've been harping on security, and just to bring that example back to the table for a second, the original assumption of the Internet was that everyone was a good guy and if there were bad guys, they were on the outside. And all I had to do was create a safe world on the inside and we all trusted each other and everything was fine.\",\n",
              " \"But of course that's not the case today. The adversaries aren't just on the outside, they're everywhere. And so we have to rethink who we trust and how we build a network up based upon those trust relationships.\",\n",
              " \"Originally the Internet assumed that the things that you connected to it with, the computers, were always plugged in, they never moved, they had sufficient power and so on. And clearly none of that's true today, because we are a very mobile world and we have mobile devices and we have very small, embedded devices that are going to be connected to the Internet very soon.\",\n",

              " \"I think it's a really great question and I'll bring this - hopefully it's not too techie - but there is sort of a philosophical difference among engineers and network - you know, there are network ideologies, and there are people who people that they really got something in the Internet's original design.\",\n",
              " \"You know, it is very equal among everything. It is - I'll use a technical term, it's a best effort network. It hasn't really been optimized for anything. It started, you know, when it began it was used for email and bulletin boards and the World Wide Web grew on top of it and then, you know, instant messaging grew on top of it, chat rooms grew on top of it, Google. All these things grew and grew and grew and even voice, even phone service has been replicated.\",\n",
              " \"So that original design, as Larry said, turned out to be a lot sturdier than people thought. And the question is whether there's - really it's that possible to improve on it. There's a big divide. And some people think yes. They think we could do better. And some people said, you know, there's something about just that very simple principle of treating everything equally that can't really be improved upon.\",\n",
              " \"And I tend to think the latter, although, you know, it's a debate in the engineering community.\",\n",
              " \"I would say if everything thinks they own the Internet and then everybody thinks, you know, I can contribute to the design of it and make it better. But if you don't think you're empowered anymore, why should you try?\",\n",

              " \"Just speaking for the research community, which is obviously a very narrow segment of those that are involved in the Internet. But the ones that feel a little bit responsible for this experiment that escaped from the lab, the Internet was something that we were able to tinker with and innovate with at one point and it's now such a commercial success that we aren't able to do that. And so we naturally gravitate towards the places that we can innovate, which is on top of the Internet.\",\n",
              " \"And there are a lot of people that believe that the Internet is just fine and that we will just go off and build new services on top of it. But the real debate gets down to can we, in fact, solve all the problems that we foresee by only working on top of today's Internet? Or do we really have to reconsider how it's designed at the core?\",\n",

Everything thought it's just a lousy design, it'll never be useful. But with the right amount of bandwidth, companies like Skype and other voice-over IP companies, which I think you're talking about later, have been very successful. And it's really surprised a lot of engineers, what's been capable on best effort.\",\n",
              " \"You know, sometimes it's very hard to improve on simplicity. Now, I'm not a security expert, and I think maybe security is one area where it's hard, but it has been surprising, video, voice, blogging, search engines, all these things have been built on top of a very simple design, which just says keep the Internet dumb and let the intelligence run at the edges, and I think that's been very important.\",\n",
              " \"And that's an interesting concept, but is the government, or any government, going to require that they should be able to hack into the Internet for security purposes? In other words...\",\n",

There's been people, there's a famous case where a Chinese dissident named Churtau(ph) because Yahoo turned over all his emails.\",\n",
